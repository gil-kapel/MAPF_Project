# Multi Agent Path Finding Solvers
### Author: Gil Kapel, Israel, [You can contact me through LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gil-kapel-a960b720a/)

Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is the problem of computing collision-free paths for a team of agents from their current locations to given destinations. Application examples include autonomous aircraft towing vehicles, automated warehouse systems, office robots, and game characters in video games. Practical systems must find high-quality collision-free paths for such agents quickly.
